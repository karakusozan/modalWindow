      In user interface design for computer applications, a modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to
      an application's main window.
      A modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child
      window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application.
      This avoids interrupting the workflow on the main window. Modal windows are sometimes called heavy windows or
      modal dialogs because they often display a dialog box.
      User interfaces typically use modal windows to command user awareness and to display emergency states, though
      interaction designers argue they are ineffective for that use.
